Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data without direct programming. It concentrates on creating models that recognize patterns, generate predictions, and enhance their performance gradually. These techniques are commonly applied in areas like image recognition, speech analysis, recommendation engines, and detecting fraud.
