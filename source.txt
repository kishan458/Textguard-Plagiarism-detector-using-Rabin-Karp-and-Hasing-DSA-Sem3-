Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on building models that can identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time. Machine learning techniques are widely used in applications such as image recognition, speech processing, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.
